# Football-Game-Engine
A design-patterns based game engine modelled after the backends of the modern football games. This project aims to implement fundamental design patterns, namely **Observer**, **Strategy**, **Decorator** and **Builder**, made famous by [Erich Gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Gamma) et al. in their book **Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software**. Support for **Reference Counted Pointers** (RCP) through `std::shared_ptr` has also been provided for smart resource management.

### Motivation
I had the pleasure to go through [Andrei Alexandrescu](https://erdani.com/)'s universally acclaimed book **Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied**, which introduced me to the area of design patterns and their uses in modern computer software such as, [SymEngine](https://github.com/symengine/symengine) and [SymPy](github.com/sympy/sympy), under which I was pursuing a GSoC project (I'm grateful to [Isuru Fernando](https://github.com/isuruf) and [Sumith Kulal](https://github.com/sumith1896) for giving me the opportunity).

### Credits 
Inspired by [Anoop Madhusudhanan](https://github.com/amazedsaint)'s article in [CodeProject](https://codeproject.com).
