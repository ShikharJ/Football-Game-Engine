# Football-Game-Engine
A design-patterns based game engine that can be used as a backend for the modern football games.

### Motivation
I had the pleasure to go through [Andrei Alexandrescu](https://erdani.com/)'s universally acclaimed book **Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied**, which introduced me to the area of design patterns and their uses in modern computer software such as, [SymEngine](https://github.com/symengine/symengine) and [SymPy](github.com/sympy/sympy), under which I was pursuing a GSoC project.

### Credits 
Inspired by [Anoop Madhusudhanan](https://github.com/amazedsaint)'s article in [CodeProject](https://codeproject.com).
